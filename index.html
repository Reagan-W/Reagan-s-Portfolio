    <h2>Back to the Future Game</h2>
    <p><a href=https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/877002124/>Play Here!</a></p>
    <p>This Back-to-the-Future-themed game has one objective: get Doc and Marty back to the present. Fly in the Delorean, collecting electricity (lightning) and avoiding the clouds. You’ll need to fill the battery to 1.21 gigawatts in order to successfully time travel. Once you do, click back to the present and you’ll see a tally in the corner of how many times you’ve time-traveled. This project propelled my understanding of programming. It was my final project for an online scratch course and incorporated what we had learned into one final game. It took hours to finish, but it was enjoyable to solve the problems along the way and create a game from the ground up.</p>

    <h2>Polygon Generator</h2>
    <p><a href=https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/898519596/>Try it out...</a></p>
    <p>This app took the critical thinking of programming, and brought it into the world of geometry. Click on a shape and watch as the pencil draws it. Also, try the custom option. Enter the number of sides and the radius of your shape, then click to draw. This project taught me to think like a computer. Any abstraction did not work, forcing me to think about the pure mathematical algorithms.

    <h2>Calculus in Music and Sound: Capstone Project</h2>

    <p>I created an apparatus with springs and weights that demonstrated the relationship between mass, frequency, and spring rigidity. The bulk of the information is within the essay and slideshow presentation. This project connected physics, calculus, and music theory and explains the math behind these concepts. As I explored the connections between subjects I learned so much more about music theory, and shared that knowledge as I presented to my classmates.
